# Modal using the `dialog` HTML element


It's a modal I made using the `dialog` HTML element or you can say the `dialog` HTML tag.

I learned this from a blog post written by  [webDevSmplified](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-04/html-dialog/).  
It's a great post, read the blog post to learn more.
